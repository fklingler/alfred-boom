Alfred 2 Boom Workflow
======================

Alfred 2 Workflow to use [boom](http://zachholman.com/boom/).  
Motherfucking text snippets on the command line, and now in Alfred!

Installation
------------

Just download and open [Boom.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/fklingler/alfred-boom/raw/master/Boom.alfredworkflow)!  
You don't even need to install boom to use it, it's packaged inside the workflow.

Usage
-----

You can use the workflow the same way you [use boom in command line](http://zachholman.com/boom/#usage), with the advantages of autocompletion!

The workflow uses [zhaocai's alfred2-ruby-template](https://github.com/zhaocai/alfred2-ruby-template) (and therefore [zhaocai's alfred-workflow gem](https://github.com/zhaocai/alfred-workflow)), which is awesome :). Look at its Readme before contributing.
